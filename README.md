# MadBox_test

## The time it took you to perform the exercise
It took me 5 hours to make the game, and there are still missing parts.

## The parts that were difficult for you and why
The player controller was difficult because I made the wrong choice and started making my own movement system based on a level-complete percentage. I then changed it to use Unity navmesh instead.

## The parts you think you could do better and how
- I could have make better camera movement, using rails.
- I should have make better ending screens (on win and lose) but I didn't had time. In the end I wrote them in the PlayerMovementController but I should call them from the MainSceneManager.
- I would have liked to make more animations for the UI, like some fades.

## What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
- I'll implement some basic IA so you can compete.
- I'll make some visual improvements, add a character model with animations for example.

## What did you think
- I think the game is playable but it's not complete. I'd liked to have more time to make it better.

## Any comment you may have
- I changed the player movement in the middle of the test because it was too rigid, it had no acceleration and the player speed would have depended on the level distance and I didn't felt comfortable about that. But I think I made the correct decision.
